They discuss the unique brain state of hypnosis and its potential to bring about positive changes in the brain, body, and other aspects of biology and psychology. Dr. Spiegel's research has shown that hypnosis can have a significant impact on symptoms of stress, chronic anxiety, chronic pain, psychiatric illnesses, and even outcomes in cancer. They also touch on the use of breathwork for anxiety, mood improvement, and better sleep. Listeners are given access to the Reverie app, developed by Dr. Spiegel and his team at Stanford, which provides effective hypnosis treatments. Overall, this episode provides valuable insights into the connection between the brain and body and offers actionable tools for improving mental and physical well-being.\""
